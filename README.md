# voltage_sweep_control
A control software interface for the SMU4201 source measure unit (SMU), specifically designed for controlling Langmuir probe voltage sweeps and generating IV (current-voltage) curves. These curves are essential for characterizing plasma properties, such as electron density, temperature, and plasma potential.
