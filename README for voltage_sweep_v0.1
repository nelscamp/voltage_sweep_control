Voltage Sweep Control v0.1:
- No GUI.
- Simple version of the voltage sweep control.
- Requires settings start voltage, end voltage, step voltage, and current limit manually within the code.
- Contains comments to navigate code.

Features:
- Live Plot
- Save to CSV (should create new files and not write over previously saved CSVs).

Note:
When running, it will take 3 seconds before sweep begins (reduce sleep time between commands to reduce this time, if desired).
